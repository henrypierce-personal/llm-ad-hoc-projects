Modena F1 Coupe 2dr Seq. Mac 6sp 3.6i [IMP],Internal Combustion Engine (ICE),Not found,Grigio alloy,Blue,Coupe,Automatic,"8 cylinders, Petrol Aspirated, 3.6L",1INQ856,2 months/August 2025,No,13 Jun 2025,SSE-AD-18908410,"44,000km",Petrol,2000,"Every motoring enthusiast should own at least one Ferrari at some point in their life  and this delightfully specified Ferrari 360 F1 Modena Coupe is your ideal introduction to the marque.

Welcome to a genuine, low mileage Ferrari 360 F1 Modena. Full regular logbook service history and lovingly maintained from new. Personally selected while i was in the UK and I just had to bring it back to Perth with me last year. Let me tell you why itâs a good one. 

 As a modern classic and one of the first Ferraris to embrace technology to control things such as the engine power curve, the F1 gearboxâs shift points, and even the ride, the 360 balances the analogue nature we all love in our classic cars with a level of reliability, performance, and safety that was unheard of even a decade before. 

If you are a discerning enthusiast who wants to experience an old school supercar but doesnât want to compromise either driving pleasure or the carâs everyday usability to get it, you will find the 360 a very attractive proposition. 

So what is my 360 like? Aluminium chassis and body are accident-free, with no corrosion. 28% lighter than the previous model F355. Australian Compliance. Since arriving in Australia it has been Engineer-certified to Australian standard, serviced including oil, filter and brake fluid changes, pit passed and then subjected to a full covers-off inspection with all advisories addressed. So, itâs properly sorted. Jump in and drive away. 

I really like the colour, which is more a silvery blue than a grey, and stylishly matches the beautiful blue leather interior. It is a stunning alternative to red and black. 

In keeping with the vast majority of new 360 buyers, I prefer the second generation F1 automated manual gearbox, over the gated manual. It is quicker, easier and smoother for a computer to operate the clutch and match the gears/engine speed. The 360 is a quick car and the F1 box makes it an absolute pleasure to drive. 

When youâre ready for a drive, press the remote to unlock the driver's door and you will hear the F1 gearbox pump priming itself. Climb in. Visibility is surprisingly good. Turn off the alarm, put your foot on the brake and let the car erupt. The F1 has the same gearbox as the gated manual and the same clutch. But a computer responds to the driver's inputs and perfectly controls the gear changes. Pull back both paddles behind the wheel for neutral. Pull back the right paddle for first gear. There are six gears. Pull the left paddle back to go down a gear. Or just let the computer do it for you. It is great fun when you get used to it and the sounds are intoxicating. For reverse, lift the small reverse lever up and then gently lift it back. 

The Ferrari 360 is very lightweight, perfectly balanced and a hoot to drive, with the best steering, surprisingly compliant suspension, no body roll, and a powerful engine with linear delivery. You will love it. The new Nouvalari Sport muffler is a little louder than OEM but offers a very well-tuned sound all the way up the rev range without the drone. It replaces the Nouvalari Super Sports muffler you hear in the video that I felt was too loud. Nouvalari are hand made to order in stainless steel by PD Gough in Nottingham and offer a unique transferable Vehicle Life guarantee. 

My 360 comes with the leather-bound book pack containing the service records and all handbooks. In the front boot are the leather-bound Ferrari complete tool kit and the original flat tyre inflator. There is no spare wheel. There is thick file on the Ferrari's history, including invoices and all its import documentation.

Options include front and rear Challenge style grilles for improved engine ventilation, Logo Scuderia Ferrari Shields on fenders, 6 CD changer, hi fi system and xenon headlights. 

Donât miss this one. Finance and extended warranty service available to approved buyers.

Immaculate rare example of the last manual Ferrari ever made. Original colour Grigio Alloy with Beige interior. 


I purchased this car from a collector (2nd owner) and have kept it immaculate since. Hardly driven. 

I purchased this car to keep it forever, however unfortunately due to a new house purchase it is unable to make it down the driveway due to the angle and unfortunately I have no choice but to let it go.

Additions include button to open exhaust values on demand and Grigio Alloy LED lights in the engine bay which look spectacular at night. 

Professional inspections welcome. Price reduced by $60,000 and only to increase in value.

The plastic dash vents fail due to heat and the leather dash pulls at the corners. The fix is Alloy aftermarket vents and full dash removal and complete re leather.
The catalytic ECU also falls giving you the SLOW DOWN lights on your dash the fix is Ricambi America aftermarket 
The 6 speed shifting mechanism has been checked and rebuilt along with new engine and gearbox mounts.This gives it the perfect shift every time
